"""Wrapper to make the environment compatible with the gymnasium API.

The drone simulator does not conform to the gymnasium API, which is used by most RL frameworks. This
wrapper can be used as a translation layer between these modules and the simulation.

RL environments are expected to have a uniform action interface. However, the Crazyflie commands are
highly heterogeneous. Users have to make a discrete action choice, each of which comes with varying
additional arguments. Such an interface is impractical for most standard RL algorithms. Therefore,
we restrict the action space to only include FullStateCommands.

We also include the gate pose and range in the observation space. This information is usually
available in the info dict, but since it is vital information for the agent, we include it directly
in the observation space.

Warning:
    The RL wrapper uses a reduced action space and a transformed observation space!
